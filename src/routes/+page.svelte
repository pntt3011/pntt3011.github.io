  <p>
    Hello I'm Tung Phan. I live in Vietnam and recently graduated from
    university.<br />
    To be honest, I feel a bit lost right now.<br />
    There isn't any particular thing I want to do.<br />
    I don't know what kind of person I want to become in the future.<br />
    That's why I can't tell you more about myself at the moment.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, I do know that I love writing, learning and helping others. That's
    why I decide to start this blog.<br />
    Each post will be about a project or idea related to a certain topic. These topics
    are not determined, as I'll write about anything that captures my interest at
    the time.<br />
    I hope you gain something new by reading my posts. It'd be even greater if you
    can apply these things into your daily life or work. That's my ultimate goal
    of this blog.
  </p>
  <p>
    I expect you can get most of my blog without any prior knowledge. Some tools
    or topics may require certain knowledge to fully understand. However,
    technologies can change over time, what's really matter is the way we
    approach and solve problems. That's the core messege I want to emphasize
    throughout this blog.
  </p>
  <p>Let's enjoy this journey together.</p>
